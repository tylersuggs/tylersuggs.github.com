A few weeks ago my 11-year-old cousin was part of a select group of 5th graders at her school chosen to attend the S.C. Young Writer's Conference in Columbia. So inspirational was that experience that she was led to tell the world about it. So, she wrote to the Editor of Darlington's News & Press... and got published! Here's her letter:

> To the Editor:
>
> Have you ever been to a Young Writers' Conference? We have.
>
> The Young Writers' Conference was a great experience for us to learn more about writing stories. The writing conference was inspirational!
>
> We met many different authors. It was very neat to see the process of making a book.
>
> the author Jerry Pallotta told us about his picture and alphabet books. He was very interesting.
>
> Another author, Lynn Floyd Write, wrote the "Flick" books and other amazing books, also. Skip is her dog that is blind. She has another dog named Nellie. the "Flick" books are based on her dog Skipper.
>
> It happened that our ELA teacher, Mrs. Howle, met Mrs. Wright many years ago and even had a picture and some books that she had written.
>
> Jan Cheripko, another of our favorite authors, taught us that asking questions is one way of making a good sentence. Look for Jan Cheripko's new book a about a tee ball.
>
> Kendall Haven, a professional storyteller, was ï¿½?also at the conference. He has written many books about science and history.
>
> When we arrived at the Young Writers' Conference, we had no desire to become authors. After attending the conference, we are all inspired to be authors!
