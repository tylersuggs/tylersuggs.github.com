Finally, after 6 years and about a Bazillion™ miles logged, I'm able to cash-in a much over due insurance claim and part ways with this pile of metal once called a wheelchair. This one arrived on my doorstep just a few days after High School Graduation (has it really been that long?!) and has been much more than it was ever designed for since. We've had a good run together, but as always, all good things must come to an end. So, in two weeks a shinier, healthier, younger model will occupy  what is left of a back seat in my car.

This one is completely tricked-out. First and foremost, it's completely adjustable <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">sans the need for tools</span> without the need to play "Mechanic" for four days straight (sweetness!). Then, the rear wheels are sporting a fancy "sport" hub with composite spokes (as opposed to standard metal spokes). The front casters sit on Frog Legs© that add suspension for a smoother ride. It's also got fold-down push handles on the back simply because I "strongly dislike" the things entirely but they do come in handy when I need a lift around places. Oh, did I mention it only weighs 12 pounds (17 pounds for my current chair)?!

So, look for action shots to come in the next few weeks.

Edit: OK, so it's not quite "tool free", but it's certainly a step up from needing a personal hardware store just to adjust something by a few inches.
