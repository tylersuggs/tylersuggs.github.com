As you all know, this past Monday was Memorial Day. This day is more than just a holiday from work and school, it's a time we should set aside to celebrate the memory of those who have fallen on the battlefields protecting the freedoms we enjoy each day, and rightfully so. Franky, I don't think our Soldiers get enough thanks for the amazing work they do. But, for me, Memorial Day is also a good time to sit down with God and reflect on our own lives.

Often, when people talk about others remembering them they ask the question, "How do you want people to remember you once you're gone?". But, isn't this really quite a loaded question? Honestly, can you name someone who would answer that question with something like "I want to be remembered as the guy who lied, cheated, and stole his way through life" and actually mean it? Of course not. No, we all *want* to be remembered for the good parts of our lives, as Saints even.

Asking what we want isn't going to get us anywhere, because we all want the same thing in regard to the world's memory of us. Instead, the question should be "How *will* people remember you once you're gone?". Seriously, think about it. If you were to die right here and now while reading this post, how would the world remember you? I'm not talking about what would be said at your funeral, we all know nothing bad about you will be mentioned there. No, I'm talking about deep down in the hearts of those you've impressed on during your life. You may call yourself Christian, but what does the World have to say about that? Most importantly, what does *God* have to say about that?

Many people live their lives as if they're in control and can do whatever they want and take their time doing it. In the words of Francis Chan, that's just crazy! In his book, *Crazy Love: Overwhelmed By a Relentless God, *Chan stresses to his readers that God created our lives for His purpose and we are to use every second of this life to glorify Him.

> **1 Corintians 10:31 (NIV):** So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.

Consider life as a book. Each day is a page, each year a chapter. Heaven then becomes God's library, but it's a picky library. God created each of us to ultimately sit on a shelf in His library and be read by the world as memories. But, a book must first be written before it makes it to any library. Every action you take, every decision you make is written into your Life's book. Then, one day, the last page will be written and like all books, it gets sent to it's Editor. But, who's name goes on the mailing label for our Life's book? Jesus Christ, Editor in Chief, that's who!

> **Matthew 10:32-33 (NIV):** "Whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.

Now, there are two possible resting places for your book. It can sit on a shelf in God's Library and shine for all to see and read, or it can lay to waste in a cardboard box in Satan's "basement". When we die, Jesus will scrutinize every single page of our book. If they don't meet his standards, then they aren't accepted into the Library's collection. I don't know about you, but I'd prefer that the book I've spent my entire life writing not remain for all eternity in a place where it might get burned! We must not forget this! We must strive to create a book that pleases God, for this is the only way to peaceful, everlasting life in Heaven!

Don't worry about the past, it's been written and cannot be changed. Instead, sit down with God and sort out the outline for the rest of your life. You don't need to fill in every detail just yet, but it's nice to have an idea of how a story is to flow. With that done, give every effort and every fiber of your being to the task of fulfilling that outline. If you start getting off-topic, again, don't worry. Just call on Jesus Christ and ask for help. After all, isn't that what Editors are for?

I'll leave you with this final challenge: Will you be Heaven's next Best Seller?
