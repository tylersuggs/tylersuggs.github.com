Last Wednesday night at Ebenezer, Justin told the story of Closet Boy. According to Justin's imagination, Closet Boy has lived his entire 17 years of life in a closet, having never gone outside it's four walls. He sleeps, eats, and, yes, goes to the bathroom in this closet. At one point in the story a visitor knocks on the closet door and offers Closet Boy three wishes. Closet Boy thinks about it really hard and comes up with these three requests:

1.  new, fresh carpet,
2.  a larger gap at the bottom of the door to allow for more light,
3.  air freshener.

Even though he was given access to anything he could possibly ask for, he never once asked for freedom. See, the mere thought of an outside world never occurs to him. He knows of only what is within the four walls of his world, the closet.

At times we become Closet Boy in our own lives; when we construct our goals and aspirations based solely on our own understanding of things. In this way, we are actually selling ourselves short. John 10 gives us a way to "broaden our horizons", so to speak:

> **John 10:10 (NIV): **The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.
> **John 10:10 (The Message): **I came so they can have real and eternal life, more and better life than they ever dreamed of.
You see, by releasing ourselves to God's Will, we are opening our lives to opportunities that we couldn't otherwise predict to be possible. The world is finite and limited. God, however, is infinite
