From Mikey:
>A woman was out Christmas shopping with her two children.
>
>After many hours of looking at row after row of toys and everything else imaginable, and after hours of hearing both her children asking for everything they saw on those many shelves, she finally made it to the elevator with her two kids.
>
>She was feeling what so many of us feel during the holiday season time of the year.
>
>Overwhelming pressure to go to every party, every housewarming, taste all the holiday food and treats, getting that perfect gift for every single person on our shopping list, making sure we don't forget anyone on our card list, and the pressure of making sure we respond to everyone who sent us a card.
>
>Finally the elevator doors opened and there was already a crowd in the car. She pushed her way into the car dragging her two kids and all the bags of stuff in with her.
>
>When the doors closed she couldn't take it anymore and stated, "Whoever started this whole Christmas thing should be found, strung up and shot."
>
>From the back of the car, everyone heard a quiet calm voice respond, "Don't worry, we already crucified Him."
>
>The rest of the trip down the elevator was pretty quiet.
>
>Don't forget this year to keep the One who started this whole Christmas thing in your every thought, deed, purchase, and word.

If we all did it, just think of how different this whole world would be. (Luke 2:1-20)
The moral of this story? Who began YOUR Christmas and what are you doing to PROVE it?

Think about it.
