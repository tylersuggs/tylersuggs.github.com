The best one yet...
<blockquote> Weekly World News, 3/14/07:

"Light Pollution Misleads the Recently Deceased"

"Activist Don Bortle wants to put a stop to light pollution -- but not just
for the benefit of the living.

'The proliferation of streetlamps, billboards and other artificial light
sources has grossly complicated the process of "moving toward the light"
after death,' he said.

Bortle started the campaign after his own near-death experience three years
ago, when he was resuscitated by paramedics on a New York City sidewalk.

'I thought that St. Peter looked surprisingly like a bouncer,' he said.
'Then I realized it was just the neon lights above Empyrean, a popular
nightclub in TriBeCa.'

Bortle and his Light Pollution Spiritual Advisory Group have helped hundreds
of afterlife-concerned people move to retirement communities near
astronomical observatories and other dark-sky preserves."

Are they actually serious??? I've heard some crazy light pollution stories, but this is borderline absurd!
