People amaze me. A simple, yet profound statement when you think about it. The things I see people do, the good and the bad, on a daily basis simply amaze me. Today was testament to both flavors, but the good seemed to quickly smother the bad. God's just awesome like that!

Today was also a hectic day which was a bit frustrating at the start. After Prayer Breakfast with the <a href="http://ebenezeryouth.com" target="_blank">Youth</a>, Danielle and I took to the streets to recruit sponsorships and door prizes for the upcoming Ebenezer Golf Tournament. This quest was promptly subdued by the heat and a series of "No Solicitation" signs at businesses we considered prime choice for door prizes. So, we eventually came to Starbucks, led by both the heat and the idea of scoring a pound of coffee or a mug or two for our yet-to-form collection of prizes. And this is where the true story begins...

After making my way to the counter I dutifully inquired about donation possibilities. The Barista on the opposite side of the counter told me that they typically do give both a pound of coffee and a pair of mugs to requests for charity. Then, she asked the million dollar question: "What's it for?". Of course, I explained that it was for the Church's Golf Tournament and the proceeds were meant to provide the Youth with new audio equipment. "Oh", she said. "Unfortunately, Starbucks won't allow us to donate to religious organizations. If you were any other non-profit, I could do something for you. I personally don't like that policy, but I have to follow it.", she continued. So, there you have it. The largest and most notable coffee beverage chain has made it company policy to not support any religiously-affiliated organization. But, fortunately this story doesn't end here.

Apparently the gentleman behind me overheard my conversation and while I was on the phone with Tory, asked Danielle about the "religiously-affiliated organization" we represented. After she explained things to him he asked to be excused for a moment, but promptly returned... with his checkbook! That's right, not agreeing with Starbucks' policy on donating to charity, he took it upon himself to do what a wealthy, world-wide corporation refused to do! "My family is very active in our church back home. So, I fully understand and support what you are trying to do. I hope this experience doesn't get you down." My un-voiced reply: "Down, are you kidding? Dude, you just made my day!"

We didn't get our expected $10 pound of coffee from our trip to Starbucks, no God had bigger plans! Instead we left with a $100 sponsorship and the prayers and blessings of one of the most awesome examples of a Good Samaritan I have ever met!

So, Mr. Salesman from Johnsonville, SC, thank you from the bottom of my heart! Not only for your generosity, but for your boldly apparent love for Christ and the messages He left behind in people like you! I pray that God will one day allow us to meet again so that I may get to know more about the kind soul God has created in you!
