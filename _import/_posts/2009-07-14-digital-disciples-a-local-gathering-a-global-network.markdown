Once upon a time I was wondering the internet in search of "Christian-oriented" WordPress themes. Somehow, this search led me to <a href="http://taviano.com/gabe">taviano.com/gabe</a>, which led me to <a href="http://twitter.com/godsmac">@GodsMac</a> (on Twitter? Follow this dude. Now!), which led me to the point of this post: <a href="http://digitaldisciples.net">digitaldisciples.net</a>.

Digital Disciples has got to be one of the most unique outreach projects I've ever come across. Basically, <a href="http://gabetaviano.com">Gabe</a> and friends meet once each month to talk and teach about some technology topic for an hour or so. Afterwards, they move into a bible study. Now, who are these "friends"? Anyone. That's right, the point of the gathering is to bring "non-tech" folks into an environment where they can learn and ask questions about various facets of technology. All of this, of course, would be free to the participants. Each meeting may even include more than one topic. The participants could then choose which session they'd like to attend that day.Â After each tech session is complete, the group, or those who wish to stay, reassemble for a Bible study.

This program's been going on in it's hometown of Columbus, OH with so much success that they are spreading the idea around in hopes of having other areas pick it up as well.

Personally, I think such a program would be an awesome ministry for this area and I think it would be met with great interest by the community. I've already spoken to several friends who are interested in seeing that happen. What I need to know now is just how many would be interested in helping with either the technology or spiritual side of things or simply attending and learning a thing or two about that dusty computer sitting in the closet.

If any of this has interested you, please contact me by <a href="http://livingproof.us/contact-me">email</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/tysuggs">twitter</a>, or comment to this post. Even if you aren't tech-savvy, I'd love to hear your thoughts on attending such a program!

Remember: you don't have to be a geek to attend!

Thanks!
