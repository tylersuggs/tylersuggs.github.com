<p>Last night was definitely one for the books&#8230;</p>

<p>It all started out pretty normal for a Independence Day weekend. Danielle and I spent the evening and well into the night at Oakdale Country Club with Tory, Jess, and friends. Everything typical of the season was there: half the county lounging by the pool, a million kids frolicking in and around the pool, beach music, karaoke, ice cream, and of course a spectacular fireworks display. Normal, right? That is, until we head home&#8230;</p>

<p>So, we drive up into Danielle&#8217;s yard, tidy, dark, empty&#8230; so it seemed. While we were chatting in the car we noticed movement toward the front of the house and I turned in time to see a glimpse of a body moving behind a tree in her yard. The odd thing was that the body didn&#8217;t continue past the tree. OK, so I AM going crazy! Cool. So, Danielle gets out of the car and heads inside. Just as her back door closes I notice movement once again from the front of her house. Only this time, the figure is headed straight for ME! I look down to my cell to call Danielle to tell her to get away from the windows. When I look back up the guy is mysteriously gone.</p>

<p>So, not knowing where this guy has gone, I tell Danielle to turn all of her lights off, lock up, and run back to the car. She does and we head to my house for the night. Once home we call 911 who sends a car to her place to check thing out. They call back around 1:00 am reporting that they found a &#8220;suspicious character&#8221; about two blocks from her home. They assure her her home is safe but it&#8217;s already past midnight so she just crashes at my house.</p>

<p>All was in order this morning. Thank God for keeping us safe!</p>
