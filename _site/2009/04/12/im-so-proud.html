<p>A few weeks ago my 11-year-old cousin was part of a select group of 5th graders at her school chosen to attend the S.C. Young Writer&#8217;s Conference in Columbia. So inspirational was that experience that she was led to tell the world about it. So, she wrote to the Editor of Darlington&#8217;s News &#38; Press&#8230; and got published! Here&#8217;s her letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To the Editor:</p>

<p>Have you ever been to a Young Writers&#8217; Conference? We have.</p>

<p>The Young Writers&#8217; Conference was a great experience for us to learn more about writing stories. The writing conference was inspirational!</p>

<p>We met many different authors. It was very neat to see the process of making a book.</p>

<p>the author Jerry Pallotta told us about his picture and alphabet books. He was very interesting.</p>

<p>Another author, Lynn Floyd Write, wrote the &#8220;Flick&#8221; books and other amazing books, also. Skip is her dog that is blind. She has another dog named Nellie. the &#8220;Flick&#8221; books are based on her dog Skipper.</p>

<p>It happened that our ELA teacher, Mrs. Howle, met Mrs. Wright many years ago and even had a picture and some books that she had written.</p>

<p>Jan Cheripko, another of our favorite authors, taught us that asking questions is one way of making a good sentence. Look for Jan Cheripko&#8217;s new book a about a tee ball.</p>

<p>Kendall Haven, a professional storyteller, was ¬?also at the conference. He has written many books about science and history.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the Young Writers&#8217; Conference, we had no desire to become authors. After attending the conference, we are all inspired to be authors!</p>
