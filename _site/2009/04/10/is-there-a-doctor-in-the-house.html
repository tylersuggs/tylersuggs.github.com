<h1>Is there a doctor in the house???</h1>

<p>So, I&#8217;ve spent the last two months looking for an Orthopedic Surgeon practicing in the Pee Dee Area. With two major hospital networks around, that task sounds pretty simple, right? Apparently not&#8230;</p>

<p>I started my quest by contacting my previous Orthopedist at MUSC, not to get an appointment, but a referral simply because he&#8217;s Pediatric (which makes me a bit older than his preferred clientele!). Upon calling, I get directed to his secretary who, for the majority of the conversation, seems baffled as to why an adult would be seeking an appointment with a Pediatric doctor. OK, perhaps I wasn&#8217;t as clear as I thought I&#8217;d been. So, I reiterated my intent; that I was seeking a referral, not treatment. &#8220;Oh, I have that for you right here!&#8221;, was her reply. Woo-hoo, now we&#8217;re getting somewhere! Best of all, that doctor is right here in Florence (Yay!).</p>

<p>So, I call the number she gave me&#8230; <em>ding ding</em> Round Two of trying to convince someone that I&#8217;m not trying to get treated by a Pediatric Surgeon. Yep, that&#8217;s right, this guy&#8217;s also just for kids! Well, I guess the poor soul on the other end of the line could sense my frustration. So, she politely volunteered to talk with the other doctors in the practice and also the practice one floor below theirs to see if anyone could help me. A day later she called me to say that while there are adult Orthopedists in the group, none felt comfortable taking on a patient with Spina Bifida (that&#8217;s me!)&#8230; <em>sigh</em>.</p>

<p>So&#8230; after all of that, I&#8217;m back where I began. Oh well, I guess I&#8217;m going to have to extend my search outside the area. I don&#8217;t really like the idea because I partially expect surgery to arise shortly after any doctor gets their hands on me. And, I really don&#8217;t like sitting in a hospital for days on end away from home. I&#8217;ve been there, done that, didn&#8217;t buy the t-shirt (although, I got a gown or two!), not going back.</p>

<p>Enough ranting for one day. I&#8217;ll leave with this simple plea: Does anyone know of a doctor in the area that might be willing to help me? Any information would be great! Leave a comment, email, or tweet!</p>
