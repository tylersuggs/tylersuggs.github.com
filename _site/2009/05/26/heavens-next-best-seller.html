<h1>Heaven's Next Best Seller</h1>

<p>As you all know, this past Monday was Memorial Day. This day is more than just a holiday from work and school, it&#8217;s a time we should set aside to celebrate the memory of those who have fallen on the battlefields protecting the freedoms we enjoy each day, and rightfully so. Franky, I don&#8217;t think our Soldiers get enough thanks for the amazing work they do. But, for me, Memorial Day is also a good time to sit down with God and reflect on our own lives.</p>

<p>Often, when people talk about others remembering them they ask the question, &#8220;How do you want people to remember you once you&#8217;re gone?&#8221;. But, isn&#8217;t this really quite a loaded question? Honestly, can you name someone who would answer that question with something like &#8220;I want to be remembered as the guy who lied, cheated, and stole his way through life&#8221; and actually mean it? Of course not. No, we all <em>want</em> to be remembered for the good parts of our lives, as Saints even.</p>

<p>Asking what we want isn&#8217;t going to get us anywhere, because we all want the same thing in regard to the world&#8217;s memory of us. Instead, the question should be &#8220;How <em>will</em> people remember you once you&#8217;re gone?&#8221;. Seriously, think about it. If you were to die right here and now while reading this post, how would the world remember you? I&#8217;m not talking about what would be said at your funeral, we all know nothing bad about you will be mentioned there. No, I&#8217;m talking about deep down in the hearts of those you&#8217;ve impressed on during your life. You may call yourself Christian, but what does the World have to say about that? Most importantly, what does <em>God</em> have to say about that?</p>

<p>Many people live their lives as if they&#8217;re in control and can do whatever they want and take their time doing it. In the words of Francis Chan, that&#8217;s just crazy! In his book, <em>Crazy Love: Overwhelmed By a Relentless God,</em>Chan stresses to his readers that God created our lives for His purpose and we are to use every second of this life to glorify Him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>1 Corintians 10:31 (NIV):</strong> So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider life as a book. Each day is a page, each year a chapter. Heaven then becomes God&#8217;s library, but it&#8217;s a picky library. God created each of us to ultimately sit on a shelf in His library and be read by the world as memories. But, a book must first be written before it makes it to any library. Every action you take, every decision you make is written into your Life&#8217;s book. Then, one day, the last page will be written and like all books, it gets sent to it&#8217;s Editor. But, who&#8217;s name goes on the mailing label for our Life&#8217;s book? Jesus Christ, Editor in Chief, that&#8217;s who!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Matthew 10:32-33 (NIV):</strong> 32&#8221;Whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my Father in heaven.33But whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, there are two possible resting places for your book. It can sit on a shelf in God&#8217;s Library and shine for all to see and read, or it can lay to waste in a cardboard box in Satan&#8217;s &#8220;basement&#8221;. When we die, Jesus will scrutinize every single page of our book. If they don&#8217;t meet his standards, then they aren&#8217;t accepted into the Library&#8217;s collection. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I&#8217;d prefer that the book I&#8217;ve spent my entire life writing not remain for all eternity in a place where it might get burned! We must not forget this! We must strive to create a book that pleases God, for this is the only way to peaceful, everlasting life in Heaven!</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t worry about the past, it&#8217;s been written and cannot be changed. Instead, sit down with God and sort out the outline for the rest of your life. You don&#8217;t need to fill in every detail just yet, but it&#8217;s nice to have an idea of how a story is to flow. With that done, give every effort and every fiber of your being to the task of fulfilling that outline. If you start getting off-topic, again, don&#8217;t worry. Just call on Jesus Christ and ask for help. After all, isn&#8217;t that what Editors are for?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll leave you with this final challenge: Will you be Heaven&#8217;s next Best Seller?</p>
