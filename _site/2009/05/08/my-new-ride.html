<h1>My New Ride</h1>

<p>Finally, after 6 years and about a Bazillion™ miles logged, I&#8217;m able to cash-in a much over due insurance claim and part ways with this pile of metal once called a wheelchair. This one arrived on my doorstep just a few days after High School Graduation (has it really been that long?!) and has been much more than it was ever designed for since. We&#8217;ve had a good run together, but as always, all good things must come to an end. So, in two weeks a shinier, healthier, younger model will occupy  what is left of a back seat in my car.</p>

<p>This one is completely tricked-out. First and foremost, it&#8217;s completely adjustable <span style='text-decoration: line-through;'>sans the need for tools</span> without the need to play &#8220;Mechanic&#8221; for four days straight (sweetness!). Then, the rear wheels are sporting a fancy &#8220;sport&#8221; hub with composite spokes (as opposed to standard metal spokes). The front casters sit on Frog Legs© that add suspension for a smoother ride. It&#8217;s also got fold-down push handles on the back simply because I &#8220;strongly dislike&#8221; the things entirely but they do come in handy when I need a lift around places. Oh, did I mention it only weighs 12 pounds (17 pounds for my current chair)?!</p>

<p>So, look for action shots to come in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>Edit: OK, so it&#8217;s not quite &#8220;tool free&#8221;, but it&#8217;s certainly a step up from needing a personal hardware store just to adjust something by a few inches.</p>
