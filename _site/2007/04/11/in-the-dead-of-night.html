<p>&#8220;Light Pollution Misleads the Recently Deceased&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Activist Don Bortle wants to put a stop to light pollution &#8211; but not just for the benefit of the living.</p>

<p>&#8216;The proliferation of streetlamps, billboards and other artificial light sources has grossly complicated the process of &#8220;moving toward the light&#8221; after death,&#8217; he said.</p>

<p>Bortle started the campaign after his own near-death experience three years ago, when he was resuscitated by paramedics on a New York City sidewalk.</p>

<p>&#8216;I thought that St. Peter looked surprisingly like a bouncer,&#8217; he said. &#8216;Then I realized it was just the neon lights above Empyrean, a popular nightclub in TriBeCa.&#8217;</p>

<p>Bortle and his Light Pollution Spiritual Advisory Group have helped hundreds of afterlife-concerned people move to retirement communities near astronomical observatories and other dark-sky preserves.&#8221;</p>
