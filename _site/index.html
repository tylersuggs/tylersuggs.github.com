<h1>Thorns</h1>
<div id="meta">Posted on 26 Nov 2010</div>
<div id="post">
<p>I&#8217;m almost certain that this year&#8217;s Thanksgiving edition of <a href='http://mikeysfunnies.com'>Mikey&#8217;s Funnies</a> was written specifically to me. It includes a tale that is not only sad and thought-provoking, but stings personally and yet, has left me quite encouraged. The complete story can be found <a href='/includes/thorns_funny.html' title='Copyright &amp;copy; 2010 Mike Atkinson | www.mikeysFunnies.com' class='fancyquote'>here</a>. Go ahead and read it, I&#8217;ll wait.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that each of us thank God daily for our &#8220;roses&#8221;, but any gardener will tell you that all roses come with thorns, and likely has the scares to prove it. The fact is, life is riddled with thorns.</p>

<p>Looking back, the past few years have been somewhat of a roller coaster. After High School, I was accepted to college on nearly full scholarship (rose), I made too many mistakes at said college (thorn, albeit self-imposed?), I began to get more involved with Church (rose), my Grandma died unexpectedly (thorn), I went from a decent job to a better one (rose), I got really sick unexpectedly and had to quit that job (thorn), I got even more involved with Church (rose), and this brings us to today, and the roller coaster continues.</p>

<p>Being involved with this church has led me back to College (there&#8217;s that rose again). Although, actually getting there has been a bit of a challenge. You see, this particular college is actually about 17 hours away from home. The home I&#8217;ve grown up in; the home I&#8217;ve lived in all of my life. But, thanks to God, I was accepted to this school a few months ago and am now gearing up to attend this coming January (rose). I actually got notice this week that my apartment on campus has been reserved (rose!).</p>

<p>However, figuring out how God wants me to pay for this adventure has been posed a bit of a challenge. Most of the scholarships I&#8217;ve found have required me to be a High School Senior (if only!) or in school already. So, I looked into an educational load. Though, I also found out this week that the loan isn&#8217;t going to work out quite as planned (thorn).</p>

<p>So, what have I learned from all of this? I&#8217;ve learned that life isn&#8217;t always rainbows and cupcakes. That in walking through the garden of Life, roses sometimes lead to thorns, and thorns lead to roses. It&#8217;s through this cycle that God teaches us to become more reliant on Him. In this way, we become a stronger person, and if we choose, a stronger Disciple.</p>

<p>I for one, am thankful for my thorns, even though I&#8217;ve rarely shown it! I&#8217;ll leave you with this prayer from Mikey&#8217;s story.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear God, I have never thanked you for my thorns. I have thanked you a thousand times for my roses, but never once for my thorns. Teach me the glory of the cross I bear; teach me the value of my thorns. Show me that I have climbed closer to you along the path of pain. Show me that, through my tears, the colors of your rainbow look much more brilliant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is my prayer for this Thanksgiving season. What thorns are you thankful for?</p>
